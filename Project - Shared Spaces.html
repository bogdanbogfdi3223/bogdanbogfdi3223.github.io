      <h1>PS1 - Project Shared Spaces</h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>For the subject of PS1, we learned to explore User Experience past the single-user interface design.<br>
        We gained knowledge on where people and technology intersect in public, as well as private spaces. The end goal was to design for an intercative space based on that knowledge.<br>

        Our client was Ipse de Bruggen, for which we created the "Adapting Room" which their employees could use. <br>
        At the end of the project, we achieved the goal of expanding our research skills and knowledge as an outcome, which will surely help us in future
        situations.</p>

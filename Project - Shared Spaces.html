    <section>
      <p>For the subject of PS1, we learned how to do basic research, as well understand the approach of research a subject and developing the skills required for that.<br>
        Part of that research understanding concerns user trialling.<br>
        In user trialling, we practiced the research technique of observing a user trying out a product after
        which we can get knowledge about the user experience of the product.<br>

        The aim of this research was to get insight into the user experience of the website of "Rijksstudio" by
        observing a participant that we chose ourselves. <br>
        At the end of the project, we achieved the goal of expanding our research skills and knowledge as an outcome, which will surely help us in future
        situations.</p>

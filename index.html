            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Bogdan and I am a third year student at the University of Applied Sciences in The Hague, studying the User Experience Design programme. 
            <br>
            <br>Aside my passion for working in Adobe XD, Photoshop and creating Pixel art, I am also passionate in customer service, therefore spending some of my time outside school as a Shift Leader/Managaer at a mexican themed restaurant. Through my experience as a manager that deals with tasks such as data administration, orders, training people and taking care of the restaurant I am assigned to work at, I aim that once I receive my UXD degree, I can follow the path of becoming a manager that would take ownership over newly created projects and lead new UX Designers to a career full of knowledge and abundance.
            <br>
            <br>
            After living for 19 years in Romania, I decided that is it time to seek more opportunities for my future by moving to the Netherlands. I am soon to celebrate my fourth year here and by how things have gone so far, without any doubt I can say that the lifestyle of this country suits everything that I had hoped for, especially since there are a lot of opportunities for any upcoming UX designers, like me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of school and work, I enjoy going out with my friends, as well as watch animated-series and play video-games on my PC/phone, plus review a bunch of apps on Google Play Store with my (so far) gained knowledge in terms of UX/UI Deisgn in hope the companies would take my feedback into account and provide a better experience for the apps/games I use on my daily life.

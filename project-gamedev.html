      <p>The name of the game is The Grand Temple, where, you are playing as the main character, whose name is
        Orion.<br>

        The main character one day wakes up in a graveyard, with none of his memories left. <br>He does not know how he
        got there or why he is there in the first place... <br>The only thing he knows is that he only has a sword and
        shield to defend himself.<br> A few moments after he wakes up... <br>He hears a voice. The voice tells him that
        he needs to look for the grand temple, and that he needs to defeat the six lords of the void in order to fulfill
        his mission, as such is his sole purpose in this forsaken land.

        We started with several ideas in the beginning, changed the a few things regarding the plot when we had to due
        to the time that we had left, however, this core idea has not changed.<br>
        I was one of the two designers of the team, so feel free to take a look at my pixel art designs I was able to
        create!

Intro - Picture
Our client’s website is called The Dutch Store. Customers that visit their website are able to
buy all kinds of Dutch goods from the Netherlands, such as foods specific to the country and
things like holiday items (almond filled butter cake, chocolate letters for Sinterklaas). The
website is strictly for the residents of USA, therefore, no international shipping is available at
the moment.
The target audience are the Dutch people that live in the USA and that miss their home
country. By purchasing products from this website they get to relive/experience moments
from their childhood through the smell and taste of the foods.

Current Problem
The design of the website is very outdated and does not fit with the times we live in where
you have beautifully designed websites with a nice and user-friendly interface or design. It’s neglecting any Gestalt principles and is not fitting to its target audience at all. The user has
a hard time navigating and has to go category by category to find what he wants, and also
the fact that the products don’t have any details/info added to them (e.g sugars/calories,
things that you will always find on other similar websites). 

Goal
Our main goal is to create a website with smooth and beautiful visuals, similar to the
average website of similar stores that you can access in the present. By incorporating designs and Gestalt principles, we will allow the target audience to browse the website in a more visual and practical manner compared to its current state. We will add extra
content with recipes, as well as more pictures and better thumbnail images to help the user
have a more friendly visit on the website.

Insights discovered from the persona:
Our persona’s name is Floor de Jong. She is a 36 years old Dutch woman who moved to USA
in 2011. She has two children (one boy and one girl). Her hobbies are healthy food and hiking.
She wants her two little kids who were born in USA learn more about Dutch culture through
Dutch cuisine.
She takes her children visiting The Netherlands every year, while her parents come to San
Francisco visit her family more often.
- Sometimes they arehaving Dutch meal such as pancakes, stamppot, and poffertjes etc at
home (in San Francisco) and sharing Dutch typical food, drinks, sweets with international
friends in party.
In America stores, typical Dutch food is not available. She asks family members bring sweets
(such as drop, lange vingers, and babbelaars) when they visit her. However, their bags limit how
much they can carry, there is never enough for all of her friends and all of their parties.
She seeds typical fresh Dutch foods like bitterballen, herring, cheese so she can share with her
family and her best friends.


Ideation
Expert Review/Things that are going to be changed
Clear dialogue - The website does not present the exact information the user needs (product details) at the exact time and place where it is needed
Stick to one language - For Non Food Items category, all the list is in English except for “Oranje Boven”, which selling T shirt and Hoodie. If people don’t understand the terms used on a site, not only will they feel unsure and ignored, but many will be forced to go elsewhere to find explanations.
Better structure - When I click on Update Quantity, the website doesn’t response.
Give power to the user - If users add an item mistakenly to a shopping basket, the website allows them to undo that change by deleting the item. When users search “chese” instead of “cheese”, there is no alternative suggestions or similar products displayed –just a responding “There are no products that match your search”. Using search suggestions help users decrease interaction cost, because they can type les

Feedback - Giving users a big list would only annoy them and make it more difficult for them to grasp, especially for those who use screen readers. Using inline validation helps with accessibility, because screen readers should read the error message and field label simultaneously, allowing all users to focus on the problem at hand

Flexibility - Users are not allowing to buy as guest. They need to log in or create an account to buy stuff. The website should provide users option shopping without an account to speed up the process.
Uniformity and consistency - The thumbnail pictures don’t share the same sizes nor position on the image which doesn’t offer uniformity.
Aim for minimalism - When taking a look at this list you can get a bit overwhelmed by the amount of the text that doesn’t have an even ration with the images/pictures of the products.

Overview of the changes:
Our revamped website prototype offers a visually captivating experience, prioritizing elements like improved visual hierarchy and consistent typography. Drawing inspiration from the vibrant national Dutch colors, we've infused warmth into the design.
Navigating the website is now more intuitive, with clear entry points and a hovering fat menu that grants easy access to essential sections. We've streamlined the filtering system for both food and non-food items, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.
Efficiency has been boosted with enhanced breadcrumb visibility and the removal of unnecessary pagination elements. Plus, we've maintained a consistent grid layout across all module tabs for a cohesive feel.
The design we created ensures that users enjoy optimal experiences across various devices, minimizing cognitive overload. We've introduced a user-friendly dropdown menu for effortless product filtering and improved visibility of user actions.
Furthermore, we've improved error message alignment to enhance user comprehension and interaction clarity. Every aspect detailed in the redesign brief has been meticulously addressed within the prototype, catering specifically to the needs of older Dutch immigrants seeking traditional Dutch products in America.

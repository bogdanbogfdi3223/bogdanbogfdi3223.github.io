      <p>Design Ethnography helps you to develop observation and interviewing skills and you apply
        these in order to empathise with a certain domain or group of people.<br>You learn to
        understand their concerns, needs and desires. <br>In my case, my target was finding out more information regarding General Managers of Five Guys, which proved that Five Guys as a company is more than just burgers and fries.
        Here you can find some questions/answers from the interviews I conducted for this design ethnography
        What do you do during delivery, what is it about?
        It’s a lot of products coming in, for example all of our potatoes, meat, lettuce, ketchup and all of that. <br>What we basically have to do is take everything from the shelves and store them in the walk-in cooler where they are supposed to be and that’s it.<br><br>
        
        So you had to get used to it and everything about that, I understand. <br>But since you are a GM now, what is your favorite thing to do, something that you wouldn’t have to do as a normal employee?
        My favorite thing to do now is to feel responsible for the shift because I got more used to it so it feels more naturally to deal with it now, especially by going into the lobby and making sure it’s clean and the customers are okay, so the responsibility.<br><br>
        
        Since you are mentioning customers, do you talk to them beside when you sell the order to them?
        What I do is for example when I am at the register, I don’t know if you watched the youtube pranks, the school campus and pranking people with funny questions, that’s what I do sometimes at the register and the customers love it but I always tell them at the end, hey guys it’s a prank.
        Haha like that, well, as long as the customers have a good time I guess it’s fine. <br>But then overall, how much do you like the job now?<br><br>
        I think the job is amazing, I also like the vibe here, it’s like different when I compare it other fast food restaurant because here at Five Guys we focus on the customer experience and the good vibes, energy. <br>We have the crew members dancing around, laughing, helping each other, having a nice chat with the customer.<br>

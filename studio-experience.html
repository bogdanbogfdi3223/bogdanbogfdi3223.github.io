    <section>
      <p>As designers, we believe Inspiration to be extremely important as fuel in creating and in taking
        action towards a goal.<br>This is why we were determined to further discover more about it.<br>The end
        goal is learning how to instill that emotion in our users, determine what triggers it, how it is felt
        among different people and in what cases it can be useful.<br>
        We started by taking a look in the mirror.<br>In this discovery process we try to figure out how we
        ourselves feel inspired, when we become inspired and how the same moments can trigger different
        responses in each one of us.<br><br>We then take it a bit further with people around us and try to
        understand how they experience this emotion.<br>
        We plan on taking this approach of going in concentric circles with our research, expanding our
        reach of users and trying to use the findings and insights from previous research phases in the new
        ones to gain a broad perspective on what Inspiration is.<br>This is so we can ultimately come up with
        a concept that applies our emotion in a useful way.<br><br>
        
        
        Something that I really really enjoyed about this project was when we had to create our own Emotional Experience for other people, so that we could make them feel the emotional that was assigned to our group.

      <p>For the subject of Research for Design, we get to learn how to do basic research. We need to build an
        understanding of research and develop research skills.<br>
        Part of that research understanding concerns user trialling.<br>
        In user trialling, we will be practicing the research technique of observing a user trying out a product after
        which we can get knowledge about the user experience of the product.<br>

        The aim of this research was to get insight into the user experience of the website of "Rijksstudio" by
        observing a participant that we chose ourselves. <br>
        We will expand our research skills and knowledge as an outcome, which will surely help us in future
        situations.</p>
